## Adjusted odds ratios for solved homicides by victim sex in Baltimore, MD

``` r

# Fit logistic regression

baltimore_solved_logistic <- 
  baltimore_df %>%

      data = ., 
      family = binomial())

    OR_upper = exp(conf.high)
  ) %>%
  select(term, log_OR = estimate, OR, OR_lower, OR_upper, p.value) %>%

Based on the logistic regression analysis of Baltimore homicides, the
odds of solving a case are 0.35 times lower for male victims compared to
female victims (OR = 0.35, 95% CI: 0.27, 0.47), after adjusting for
victim age and race.

Based on the plot, in most cities cases with male homicide victims
appear to have lower odds of being solved, compared to cases with female
homicide victims. This is because most of the odds ratios observed are
less than 1. Of these cities, San Bernandino, Albuquerque, Durham,
Richmond, Savannah, Tampa, San Francisco, Boston, Nashville, Tulsa,
Birmingham and Oklahoma have confidence intervals that cross 1,
indicating that for these cities, the odds ratio difference between male
and female victims is not statistically significant.

Only Stockton, Minneapolis, Fresno have odds ratios greater than 1,
however they are not significant based on the confidence intervals
observed which include 1.
